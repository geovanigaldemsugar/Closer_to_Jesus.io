commercially reasonable efforts consistent with industry standard

use. Nothing in this section will reduce or limit
<span class="coverpage_link">Provider’s</span> obligations regarding
Personal Data that may be contained in Usage Data or Customer Content

impacts the Product or others, then
<span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> may temporarily suspend

charge the credit card, debit card, or other payment method on file for
Fees according to the <span class="orderform_link">Payment

Information does not include information that (a) Recipient knew without
any obligation of confidentiality before disclosure by Discloser; (b) is
or becomes publicly known and generally available through no fault of
Recipient; (c) Recipient receives under no obligation of confidentiality

<li><p><span class="header_2" id="12">General Terms</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="header_3" id="12.1">Entire Agreement.</span> This
Agreement is the only agreement between the parties about its subject
and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous statements
(whether in writing or not) about its subject.
<span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> expressly rejects any terms
included in <span class="coverpage_link">Customer’s</span> purchase
order or similar document, which may only be used for accounting or
administrative purposes. No terms or conditions in any
<span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> documentation or online
vendor portal will apply to
<span class="coverpage_link">Customer’s</span> use of the Product unless
expressly agreed to in a legally binding written agreement signed by an
authorized <span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> representative,
regardless of what such terms may say.</li>
<li><span class="header_3" id="12.2">Modifications, Severability, and
Waiver.</span> Any waiver, modification, or change to the Agreement must
be in writing and signed or electronically accepted by each party. If
any term of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable
by a relevant court or governing body, the remaining terms of this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The failure of a party
to enforce a term or to exercise an option or right in this Agreement
will not constitute a waiver by that party of the term, option, or
right.</li>
<li><span class="header_3" id="12.3">Governing Law and Chosen
Courts.</span> The <span class="keyterms_link">Governing Law</span> will
govern all interpretations and disputes about this Agreement, without
regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The parties will bring any
legal suit, action, or proceeding about this Agreement in the
<span class="keyterms_link">Chosen Courts</span> and each party
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
<span class="keyterms_link">Chosen Courts</span>.</li>
<li><span class="header_3" id="12.4">Injunctive Relief.</span> Despite
Section 12.3 (Governing Law and Chosen Courts), a breach of Section 10
(Confidentiality) or the violation of a party’s intellectual property
rights may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages cannot
adequately compensate. As a result, upon the actual or threatened breach
of Section 10 (Confidentiality) or violation of a party’s intellectual
property rights, the non-breaching or non-violating party may seek
appropriate equitable relief, including an injunction, in any court of
competent jurisdiction without the need to post a bond and without
limiting its other rights or remedies.</li>
<li><span class="header_3" id="12.5">Non-Exhaustive Remedies.</span>
Except where the Agreement provides for an exclusive remedy, seeking or
exercising a remedy does not limit the other rights or remedies
available to a party.</li>
<li><span class="header_3" id="12.6">Assignment.</span> Neither party
may assign any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other party. However, either party may
assign this Agreement upon notice if the assigning party undergoes a
merger, change of control, reorganization, or sale of all or
substantially all its equity, business, or assets to which this
Agreement relates. Any attempted but non-permitted assignment is void.
This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties and their permitted successors and assigns.</li>

<span class="coverpage_link">Provider</span> gives

&amp; Warranty From Provider) does not apply to any Beta Products.

<span class="coverpage_link">Provider’s</span> discretion with or
without notice.</li>
<li><span class="header_3" id="12.8">Logo Rights.</span>

There are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.</li>
<li><span class="header_3" id="12.12">Force Majeure.</span> Neither
party will be liable for a delay or failure to perform its obligations
of this Agreement if caused by a Force Majeure Event. However, this
section does not excuse <span class="coverpage_link">Customer’s</span>
obligations to pay Fees.</li>
<li><span class="header_3" id="12.13">Export Controls.</span>
<span class="coverpage_link">Customer</span> may not remove or export

discretion, with applicable export controls and sanctions laws and
regulations.</li>
